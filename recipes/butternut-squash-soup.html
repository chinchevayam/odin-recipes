<h3>Spicy Autumn Squash Soup: A Creamy Comfort</h3>
<p>Step out of the chilly weather and into the warmth of a cozy bowl of autumn squash soup. A touch of spicy chili adds a comforting heat, while the addition of crème fraîche gives it a velvety smoothness.</p>
<ul>Ingredients
    <li>1 butternut squash, about 2lb, peeled and deseeded</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 onions, diced</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 mild red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
    <li>30oz hot vegetable stock</li>
    <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche, plus more to serve</li>
</ul>
<ol>Steps
    <li>Heat the oven to 400F/360F fan.</li>
    <li>Cut the squash into large cubes, about 1½in across, then toss in a large roasting tin with 1 tbsp of the olive oil.</li>
    <li>Roast for 30 mins, turning once during cooking, until golden and soft.</li>
    <li>While the butternut squash cooks, melt the butter with the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, then add the onions, garlic clove and three-quarters of the chillies.</li>
    <li>Tip the butternut squash into the pan, add the stock and crème fraîche, then whizz with a stick blender until smooth. For a really silky soup, put the soup into a liquidiser and blitz it in batches.</li>
    <li>Return to the pan, gently reheat, then season to taste. Serve the soup in bowls with swirls of crème fraîche and a scattering of the remaining chopped chilli.</li>
</ol>
