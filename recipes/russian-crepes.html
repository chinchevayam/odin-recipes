<p>Discover the art of creating light and airy Russian crepes known as Blini, sure to win over your loved ones and steal the show at any brunch gathering.</p>
<ul>Ingredients
    <li>2 cups flour</li>
    <li>3.5 cups buttermilk or kefir</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<ol>Steps
<li>In a large mixing bowl mix eggs, flour, 1 cup of buttermilk, baking soda, oil, sugar and salt with a whisk. It's important to incorporate liquid gradually to avoid lumps. When the mixture is smooth and lump free, add remaining buttermilk.</li>
<li>Let stand for 20 minutes. You should see small bubbles on the surface of your batter.</li>
<li>Preheat your non-stick frying pan on medium heat and grease it with an cooking oil.</li>
<li>With a ladle or a measuring cup pour Â½ cup of batter in the pan and tilt the pan slightly so batter runs to the edges forming a thin and round crepe. Cook it until the top of the crepe looks dry, then flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute longer.</li>
<li>Remove to a platter and spread a little butter if desired. Repeat with the next crepe and continue cooking until all batter is used. Stack the crepes on top of each other.</li>
</ol>
